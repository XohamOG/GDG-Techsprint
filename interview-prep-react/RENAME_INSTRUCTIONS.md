# Folder Rename Instructions

The folder is currently named `interview-prep-react` but should be renamed to `frontend`.

## To Complete the Rename:

1. **Stop the development server** (press `q` in the terminal or Ctrl+C)
2. **Close VS Code** completely
3. **Manually rename the folder** in File Explorer from `interview-prep-react` to `frontend`
4. **Reopen the folder** in VS Code

Or simply use the folder as is - the package.json has already been updated to use the name "frontend".

## Current Status:

✅ All code errors fixed (border-3 → border-4)
✅ Vite config updated for ES modules
✅ Package.json name changed to "frontend"
✅ Development server running at http://localhost:5173
⏳ Folder rename pending (file lock issue)

The application is fully functional regardless of the folder name!
